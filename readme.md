## EPUB Previewer

EPUB Previewer is created 

#### Features
- Supports EPUB 2.0+
- Fast preview in the default browser
- Compiles TOC from multiple sources, to handle bad .epub files (looking at you, Calibre!)
- Ability to add your own CSS
- creates "author - title.epub" filename you can copy to clipboard from preview

### Help wanted!
The preview HTML and CSS could use some touch-up - it is not properly responsive and could look a whole lot better

#### Changelog
- 1.0 Everything is new
